//Part 2
This "Moving Toon" shader gives the illusion of movement when moving the camera side to side. 
I used the given toon shader that was taught in class and adjusted it to make the shaded part move from one side to another. Through making it look metalic and giving it a few other settings, now when the camera is moved it also looks like it moves.
I have no idea how to make a diagram on this :)

//Part 3
I tried to create a sand texture with a colour gradiate texture mixed with some colour so I could change it from a white to a yellow colour to make it more like sand. At least that was my thouguht process. 
This is to get the texture of the grainy sand and then of course the signature yellow colour
